## Enchanting TightVNC on the Domain Controller

To unleash the full potential of TightVNC, embark on this magical quest to install it on your domain controller:

1. As a wizard with administrative privileges, login to your domain controller.

2. With a wave of your wand, open PowerShell ISE as an administrator.

3. Copy and paste the "TightVNC_Installation_DC_Script.ps1" into PowerShell ISE with Administrator Privilege and Run the code. Watch as the magic unfolds!

4. Forge a new Group Policy Object (GPO) or alter an existing one within your Active Directory realm.

5. Venture to the "Computer Configuration" section of the GPO and under "Policies," select "Windows Settings."

6. Click on 'Scripts,' as if summoning spirits, and then 'Startup/Shutdown.'

7. Under the 'PowerShell Scripts' tab, click 'Add,' then 'Browse.' Cast your gaze upon the 'install-tightvnc.ps1' [crafted in Step 3], and press 'OK.' With a final incantation of 'Apply' and 'OK,' the magic is sealed!

9. Link the GPO to the Organizational Unit (OU) housing the target PCs. You may need to employ your enchanting skills.

10. Check for read+execute permissions and verify the GPO Security Filtering to ensure the magic flows freely.

11. As the PCs receive the GPO, TightVNC Server will be silently installed, and the enchanting password you've conjured shall be set.
